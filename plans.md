Add some kind of timer based rotating color. Shouldn't be too hard to program :)
Can use timer_read and timer_elapsed functions to make it work, stuff like that. Yay!

Add more git macros

Add some vim macros for some of the coc commands

Recompilable color modes for different keycap sets would be a nice to have

Add macro keys for commonly used emojis, plus some of those japanese text emoji things
